# linux420-TkG config file

# Set to true to use modprobed db to clean config from unneeded modules. Speeds up compilation considerably. Requires root - https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Modprobed-db
# !!!! Make sure to have a well populated db !!!! - Leave empty to be asked about it at build time
_modprobeddb="false"


#### KERNEL OPTIONS ####

# LEAVE AN EMPTY VALUE TO BE PROMPTED ABOUT IT AT BUILD TIME

# CPU scheduler - Options are "pds", "muqss" or "cfs"
_cpusched="muqss"

# Set to "true to disable FUNCTION_TRACER/GRAPH_TRACER, lowering overhead but limiting debugging and analyzing of kernel functions - Kernel default is "false"
_ftracedisable="true"

# Set to "true" to disable NUMA, lowering overhead, but breaking CUDA/NvEnc on Nvidia equipped systems - Kernel default is "false"
_numadisable="true"

# Set to "true" to use explicit preemption points to lower latency at the cost of a small throughput loss - Can give a nice perf boost in VMs - Kernel default is "false"
_voluntary_preempt="false"

# Set to "true" to enable Device Tree and Open Firmware support. If you don't know about it, you don't need it - Default is "false"
_OFenable="false"

# Set to "true" to use ACS override patch - https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/PCI_passthrough_via_OVMF#Bypassing_the_IOMMU_groups_.28ACS_override_patch.29 - Kernel default is "false"
_acs_override="false"

# Set to "true" to use KSM/UKSM. You'll be prompted about which one to use during kernel config - https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/vm/ksm.txt - https://github.com/dolohow/uksm
_ksm_uksm="true"

# Set to "true" to add Bcache filesystem support. You'll have to install bcachefs-tools-git from AUR for utilities - https://bcachefs.org/ - If in doubt, set to "false"
_bcachefs="false"

# Set to "true" to add BFQ-MQ support. This is the development version of BFQ - https://github.com/Algodev-github/bfq-mq - If in doubt, set to "false"
_bfqmq="false"

# A selection of patches from Zen/Liquorix kernel and additional tweaks for a better gaming experience (ZENIFY) - Default is "true"
_zenify="true"

# CPU compiler optimizations - Defaults to generic optimizations if left empty
# AMD CPUs : "k8" "k8sse3" "k10" "barcelona" "bobcat" "jaguar" "bulldozer" "piledriver" "steamroller" "excavator" "zen"
# Intel CPUs : "mpsc"(P4 & older Netburst based Xeon) "atom" "core2" "nehalem" "westmere" "silvermont" "sandybridge" "ivybridge" "haswell" "broadwell" "skylake" "skylakex" "cannonlake" "icelake"
# Other options :
# - "generic" (to share the package between machines with different CPUs)
# - "native" (use compiler autodetection and will prompt for P6_NOPS - Selecting your arch manually in the list above is recommended instead of this option)
_processor_opt="zen"

# Make IRQ threading compulsory (FORCE_IRQ_THREADING) - MuQSS only - Default is "false"
_irq_threading="false"

# SMT (Hyperthreading) aware nice priority and policy support (SMT_NICE) - Kernel default is "true" - You can disable this on non-SMT/HT CPUs for lower overhead
_smt_nice="true"

# Trust the CPU manufacturer to initialize Linux's CRNG (RANDOM_TRUST_CPU) - Kernel default is "false"
_random_trust_cpu="false"

# CPU scheduler runqueue sharing - No sharing (RQ_NONE), SMT (hyperthread) siblings (RQ_SMT), Multicore siblings (RQ_MC), Symmetric Multi-Processing (RQ_SMP), NUMA (RQ_ALL)
# Valid values are "none", "smt", "mc", "smp", "all" - Kernel default is "mc"
_runqueue_sharing="mc"

# Timer frequency - "750" or "1000" - More options available in kernel config prompt when left empty depending on selected cpusched - Kernel default is "750"
